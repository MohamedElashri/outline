If you want to rerun install script, run `git clean -ffdx` to clear all the data from previous installation. Otherwise you might get weird authentication/401 errors.

## Trouble shooting

### Login gets stuck at slack *

- Does data/minio_root contain directory called outline-bucket?
- Is port to communicate from server to itself via internet open in your firewall?
 
### After login to slack, you get 'Not Found'*

 - Are you using same secret key which you used to initialize the postgres (pgdata).
    If not, do `make clean` to remove old DB and related meta.

### Images don't upload/load. 401 error for /attachments.redirect (in the network tab of developer tools)*

- Same as above. You should probably be using old database but your keys are different now.
- Are you behind a HTTPS proxy? Then you'll need to setup HTTPS for minio too.
- Check this out if you see KMS in dev logs (yarn dev): https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/6367

### Images don't upload/load. 404 error for /outline-bucket *

- Are you sure there's a directory `data/minio_root/outline-bucket`


### Not tested for *HTTPS*!

- Minio cause lot of issues with https! Better use fakes3 for self-hosted
